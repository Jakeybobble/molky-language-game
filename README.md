# Molky Language Game
A school assignment project.

## What did I learn from this?
- There is a thing such as too many web components.
- Event listeners in JavaScript are weird.
- The difference between using shadow roots and not doing so.
- That I love using template slots.
- It's harder to use bootstrap and web components together. :-(
